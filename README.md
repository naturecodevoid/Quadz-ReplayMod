This is my personal fork of Quadz, an FPV racing drone mod for minecraft. You can find the original project [here](https://github.com/LazuriteMC/Quadz). This fork is based off commit [022af66](https://github.com/LazuriteMC/Quadz/commit/022af66a78beb61dba95bb723d473d1543617506). This branch adds the (currently broken) feature to export camera positions to a ReplayMod timeline. During development I realized that this is the default behavior when recording replays and this feature is not needed, so I will not be fixing this branch.
